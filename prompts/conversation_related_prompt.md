## Classify New Conversation Topic Prompt

Analyze if this message indicates a new conversation topic. If it does, extract a 2-3 word title that captures the new topic. Format your response as a JSON object with two fields: 'isNewTopic' (boolean) and 'title' (string, or null if isNewTopic is false). Only include these fields, no other text.
