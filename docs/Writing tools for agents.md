## Choosing the right tools for agents

Make sure _each tool you build has a clear, distinct purpose_.

Tools should enable agents to subdivide and solve tasks in much the same way that a human would.

Too many tools or overlapping tools can also distract agents from pursuing efficient strategies. Careful, selective planning of the tools you build (or donâ€™t build) can really pay off.

## Namespacing your tools

Namespacing (grouping related tools under common prefixes) can help delineate boundaries between lots of tools For example, namespacing tools by service (e.g., asana_search, jira_search) and by resource (e.g., asana_projects_search, asana_users_search), can help agents select the right tools at the right time.

> Selecting between prefix- and suffix-based namespacing to have non-trivial effects on tool-use evaluations.

## Returning meaningful context from your tools

Tool implementations should take care to return only high signal information back to agents.
